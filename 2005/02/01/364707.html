<hr/> <!-- Archival Source: ProcessPostOld -->
<P>A few years back (some time before Windows XP shipped)&nbsp;when we located in were in Building 9 and much smaller than we are now, someone else in the building was having a problem. Our kind of problem. An international problem. I don't remember what it was -- something to do with code pages, maybe?</P>
<P>Anyway, Wei Wu, one of our cool development leads, asked a few configuration questions, and at the end of the message, asked him "what is your default system locale?".</P>
<P>His response, which I cannot find a copy of now, was priceless. Assuming that Wei was going to stop by to look at the machine. this guy started to describe the location of his computer.... :-)</P>
<P>One of those jokes that most people won't quite get, and jokes are never funny if they have to be explained. Ah, the life of an international geek. </P>
<P>But it was pretty funny, I think. We all&nbsp;had a good laugh at the time.</P>
<P>There is a not-so-hidden truth in there -- our terminiology story is weak. It really ought to be better. So, once again, here is a&nbsp;quick glossary of the four most common&nbsp;<STRONG>types of locales</STRONG>:</P>
<P><STRONG>DEFAULT USER LOCALE</STRONG> (Windows XP term: "Standards and Formats"):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>This setting controls the way information is presented -- the sort order in list boxes, the format of date, time, number, and currency values, the calendar you prefer to use. The list of locales can be thought of as a big group of defaults that are grouped by many language/region pairings, which you can see in the first tab&nbsp;<a href="#8424">Regional and Language Options</A> Control Panel applet. Several of the settings are customizable, particularly the various formats.</P>
<P>The setting is per-user and when you change the setting, it is effective immediately, and all top level windows in the user's windowstation will get a <A title=WM_SETTINGCHANGE href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/sysinfo/base/wm_settingchange.asp" target=_blank>WM_SETTINGCHANGE</A> message indicating that the change has happened so that they too can reflect the change immediately.</P>
<P>Developers will commonly use LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT as their LCID of choice, whether by doing so directly or by calling functions in SHELL, USER, or elsewhere that do so for them. Using this setting and behaving appropriately with the results thereby is a sure sign that the developer respects the user's settings.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>DEFAULT SYSTEM LOCALE </STRONG>(Windows XP term: "Language for non-Unicode Programs"):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>This setting has three major purposes:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Specifies the default&nbsp;ANSI, OEM, MAC, and EBCDIC code pages to use for non-Unicode programs. 
<LI>Specifies some of the font linking preferences for CJK fonts and for legacy bitmap fonts. 
<LI>Specifies application behavior when developers incorrectly use this setting rather than the DEFAULT USER LOCALE.</LI></OL>
<P>This setting is found on the third tab of the Windows XP/Server 2003 <A id=CategoryEntryList href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/11/279998.html">Regional and Language Options dialog</A>&nbsp;and in the "Default" button on the first tab of the Windows 2000 <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/11/279997.html">Regional Options dialog</A>.</P>
<P>Changing the setting changes it for the entire machine and it requires a reboot to take effect. No notification mechanism is done, nor is one needed since no change happens until the reboot does. A small number of misbehaving applications which check the registry rather than using the APIs will get wrong results after the setting change but before the reboot.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, developers will sometimes use LOCALE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT for purposes other than #1 and #2, and by doing so they manage to simultaneously show their users disrespect and cause yet another compatibility weirdness with functionality tied to the default system locale. Given the fact that a reboot is required, you think people would avoid this, but dven developers are not always perfect.</P>
<P>The XP name should be a big hint, though sometimes it adds confusion.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>DEFAULT USER INTERFACE LANGUAGE </STRONG>(Windows XP Term: "Language used in menus and dialogs"):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>This setting controls the language in which the UI is presented. It is only present if you have the MUI version of Windows (which is to say that you have Windows with the multilanguage files installed).</P>
<P>This setting is found on the second tab of the Windows XP/Server 2003 <A id=CategoryEntryList href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/11/279998.html">Regional and Language Options dialog</A>&nbsp;and in the middle of the first tab of the Windows 2000 <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/11/279997.html">Regional Options dialog</A>.</P>
<P>The setting is per-user and changing it requires a logoff to take effect.</P>
<P>There is no constant for it but the <A title=GetUserDefaultUILanguage href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_5c85.asp" target=_blank>GetUserDefaultUILanguage</A> API will retrieve&nbsp;the&nbsp;setting&nbsp;quickly enough. Given the changes to the resource model that the changes to support MUI inspired, it is easy for applications to plug into the very same setting automatically. I'll talk more about this another time....</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>DEFAULT INPUT LOCALE </STRONG>(Windows XP Term: "Default Input Language"):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>This setting controls the initial input language used for all newly created threads.</P>
<P>This setting is found on the second tab of the Windows XP/Server 2003 <A id=CategoryEntryList href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/11/279998.html">Regional and Language Options dialog</A>&nbsp;(hit the "Details..." button) and on the last tab of the Windows 2000 <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/11/279997.html">Regional Options dialog</A>.</P>
<P>The setting is per-user and it takes place immediately. But obviously will not change the input language on any existing threads; only new threads get the new default. </P>
<P>Developers can find out what the current setting is by calling the&nbsp;<A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/sysinfo/base/systemparametersinfo.asp">SystemParametersInfo</A> API with the SPI_GETDEFAULTINPUTLANG parameter. You can even set it with the SPI_SETDEFAULTINPUTLANG parameter but this almost always something that a developer should not be doing -- it is a user preference. Since proper application behavior is mostly about respect, this really is a constant that you should avoid. :-)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For more on this topic, Dr. International has bigger lists <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/drintl/columns/009/default.mspx">here</A>&nbsp;and <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/DrIntl/faqs/Locales.mspx">here</A>, and there is more information <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/loclanghome.mspx">here</A>. </P>
<P>But when you are a developer, respect is the key here -- respect of the user's preferences and settings.</P>
<P>When you are a user, consider which applications respect your settings and which do not. Because while doing so may not be convenient for an application, it is certainly possible....</P>

I call them the setlocale and <a title="GetACP" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_21bk.asp" target="_blank">GetACP</a> settings respectively. Delphi 7 has this problem in its core SysUtils functions because it uses the code page associated with the default user locale in some of its Ansi String functions (which on Windows is absolutely wrong). Very few programmers seem to be aware of this issue, I guess because often they are the same code pages. The MSDN documentation is plain wrong in many places, such as setlocale where it says the &quot;system-default ANSI code page obtained from the operating system&quot;.</div>

In fact, as a programmer I suppose you might need to explicitly deal with this user locale code page if you are handling strings from date time functions in a non-UNICODE program.</div>

At the moment, each time I install Windows XP, I have to dig through numerous dialogs and change lots of different settings from &quot;English US&quot; to &quot;English UK&quot; and then change the time zone to GMT and put up with that annoying error message when I want to delete the US keyboard so only a UK keyboard is installed.  I know that some people might want to have unusual combinations of locales and time zones and keyboards but it would be nice if the installer offered sensible defaults for the common (non-US) cases.  It would also be nice if it asked all these questions at the beginning or end of the install so I could just leave the installer to get on with it rather than having to feed it more information every five minutes.<br>&lt;/rant&gt;<br></div>
<p><a id="365397" href="#365397">#</a> <strong>Michael Kaplan</strong> on Wednesday, February 02, 2005 6:15 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Funny, when I was first reading I was confused as I though you meant .MSI files when you said &quot;Windows Installer&quot;, rather than thinking literlly the &quot;Installer program for Windows.&quot;<br><br>That is a worthwhile &quot;rant&quot; -- we are intuitive within a SKU but often they do not customize SKUs for english languages since &quot;English is already supported&quot;. I believe MS does the same thing with Spanish as well....<br><br>So it is easy to get that &quot;local&quot; feel, *if* you live in right location and buy a copy of Windows meant for that location. Which is great for that subset. But I think the rest of the world deserves that, too -- up to and including the right &quot;flavour&quot; and &quot;localisation&quot; of English or whatever the language is!</div>

I am not so keen on that as it would be more cases to test – if I can’t recreate a bug, is it because I am using a different version of English or is it something else.  Also, having a CD for each common locale would probably use up the entire global supply of what ever resource CDs need to produce the hundreds of extra MSDN Universal CDs that would be needed.<br><br>I think it would be better to make the first screen of regional settings dialog (the one with lots of text and two customize buttons) offer a combo with the common combinations of machine locale / default non-Unicode language / time zone / keyboard / etc.  That way, most users could just pick their something appropriate to their location, eg &quot;English, UK&quot;, from the list and everything else would drop into place with the option of changing the settings in the current way if they wanted something slightly different.<br><br>Another alternative would be to move all locale settings to a list of combos on one dialog so it would be easy to set them all in one go (at the moment, it is a bit frustrating seeing each of the places the first dialog says “English US” in the two long text strings and trying to find UI to change them - perhaps these strings could be hyperlinks).<br><br>If you consider this issue in terms of (number of times English Windows XP is installed outside of the US) x (amount of time it takes to dig through all those dialogs) it multiplies up to a large amount of time.<br><br>Also, the current installer makes it very easy for non-US users to install multiple keyboards when they really meant to just install the one non-US keyboard they wanted (it is not obvious that you need to delete the US keyboard and when you do, you get a scary error message as the installer is currently using the layout).  This in turn leads to the problem a few weeks later when the user accidentally presses the shortcut that changes the current keyboard layout and then complains that their keyboard is broken as some of the symbols have been swapped (I think the double quote key is in different places on US and UK keyboards for example).<br>&lt;/longer-rant&gt;</div>
