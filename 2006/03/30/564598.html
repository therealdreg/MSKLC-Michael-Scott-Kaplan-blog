<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Back near the beginning of the month, when I posted about how <STRONG><A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/07/545097.html">Everybody's doing the wraparound....</A></STRONG>, I talked about how the particular implementation of multiple combining </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>diacritic weights led to an interesting situation on Windows where the secondary, a.k.a. DW or 'diacritic weight', weight would wrap around.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Regular reader Maurits <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/07/545097.html#564145">suggested</A> a real problem that seemed to be possible:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>Hmmm... I just thought of a potentially serious problem with the third method (wrap.) &nbsp;What if the value wraps to 0xfe or 0xfd? &nbsp;Then when you add 2, you get 01 or (worse?) 00. <BR><BR>In particular: <BR><BR>"e" with 15 tildes will have a DW of 15 * 17 which comes to 255; add 2 and you wrap to 1. <BR><BR>"e" with 5 circumflexes and 12 tildes will have a DW of (5 * 10) + (12 * 17) = 254; add 2 and you wrap to 0. <BR><BR>On the other hand, what are the odds of encountering a string with such a diacritically-loaded character? </EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This was before he had actually tested things out -- once he did, his <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/07/545097.html#564274">report</A> was slightly different:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>I was trying to generate an example string that wraparounded (ugh) to 00 or 01, but I couldn't (on Windows 2000) <BR><BR>Maybe I'm trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist? </EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, let's back up a second....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>He is indeed right, the sort keys never seem to get created with bogus 0x00 or 0x01 weights inserted (therefore the bug Atsushi Enomoto <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/15/429279.html#429337">reported</A> still stands alone as the bug that inserts one of these byte sequences when it is not expected!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(That was another bug found through blogging!)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But that does not mean there is no bug in this case.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now&nbsp;I suspected there&nbsp;might be a bug here after Maurits reported the original problem -- and after looking at it&nbsp; tonight I managed to find one....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>By carefully applying <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/12/491519.html"><STRONG>Tester's Axiom #5</STRONG></A> and the knowledge that there is a potentially incorrect issue with the implementation, what can we find out here?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, if you look at <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/05/477108.html"><STRONG>How to track down collation bugs</STRONG></A>&nbsp;from late last year, you will notice a couple of things:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So, it looks like functions like <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/resources/strings/stringreference/stringfunctions/comparestring.asp">CompareString</A> (and its managed equivalent) will consistently wrap around and give expected results, while <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_5s2v.asp">LCMapString</A> for sort keys and <STRONG>its</STRONG> managed equivalent will, in an effort to avoid the problem with embedded invalid bytes will occasionally drop them.</FONT></P>

You are doing a wrong thing when you add &quot;values&quot; of combining characters to calculate a sort key.<br>For example, two strings U+0063 U+0307 U+030D and U+0063 U+0308 have the same sort key (0E 21 01 13 01 01 01 00). According to the mechanism to calculate sort keys you explained in the earlier entry &quot;Everybody's doing the wraparound....&quot;, apparently this has nothing to do with wraparound.<br>Moreover, string.Compare returns 0 when you compare these two strings. In other words, string.Compare(&quot;e\u0307\u030D&quot;, &quot;e\u0308&quot;, true, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture) gives 0.<br>I obtained these results by a small C# program written with Visual Studio 2005 on Windows XP SP2 Japanese. I am not familier with the .NET CLI environment, but this is not desirable, is it?<br><br>By the way, I have been reading your blog for a few months but this is the first time I post a comment. Let me thank you for writing many interesting topics. I especially like Every Character Has a Story entries.<br><br>- Tsuyoshi</div>

If so, that would allow e'^ == e^'.</div>

I should have searched &quot;invariant culture&quot; on your blog and read any entries before I post. Sorry for a noise.<br><br>My current understanding is that if there is a culture where both &quot;e\u0307\u030D&quot; and &quot;e\u0308&quot; are used, then they have differnt sort keys and they compare as different strings in that culture.<br><br>(And I meant string.Compare(&quot;e\u0307\u030D&quot;, &quot;e\u0308&quot;, false, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture) when I wrote true instead of false.)</div>

As you know, I did not know what string.Compare do or what the invariant culture is for when I wrote the first comment. Now I know:<br>- string.Compare(string, string, boolean, CultureInfo) performs a linguistic comparison, which means the two strings must be meaningful in the specified culture; otherwise, the result will be unpredictable or at least difficult to interpret.<br>- Not every string is considered meaningful in the invariant culture.<br><br>Therefore...<br><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/29/344136.html">http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2004/12/29/344136.aspx</a><br>&gt; That problem remains to this day, though every single time I speak at a conference or answer a question in a newsgroup or get someone to look at posts like this one, then there is at least one less developer who has this problem. Maybe this time it is you? :-)<br>Yay, it's me!<br><br>...sigh. I will never confuse the linguistic comparison in the invariant locale/culture with the ordinal comparison!</div>
